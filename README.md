Born in the mid-70s, a child of the 80s, with high school and military service in the 90s.

I've been a computer geek since Christmas 1983, when my father bought an old TRS-80 computer for my brother and I to share.

I've mostly stayed away from doing computers professionally; I chose my degree somewhat poorly and it's in a field that's only distantly related to what I actually wanted to do.

Please note that all I have here are projects forked from toher Github users. I don't upload my personal projects to Github; let's call it "trust issues" and leave it at that.
